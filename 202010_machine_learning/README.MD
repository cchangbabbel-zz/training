## Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning
### Training material & notes

### Before selecting ML algorithm: 


### Supervised Learning
- You have a lot of examples where you know the right answer. You train algorithm with features (input), and it predicts labels (output) = classification. 
- Before selecting algorithm: 
    - visualize data with scatter plot. 
        - are there clear or unclear patterns? given past data, what can you say about a new data point? 
        - decision surface: if on one side can classify as label X, on the other side can classify as Y. If on "line", then it's unclear which label. example given: linear decision surface. 
- Takes input and transforms to decision surface so that you can classify future data points. 

#### Learned 3 type of Supervised algorithms: 
1. Naive Bayes
2. SVM
