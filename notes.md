What do computers do? 
1. performs calculations
    - really fast
    - built-in (simple), plus we can build ones
    - simple not enough -> ex: chess game: still need algorithmic thinking
2. remembers results
    - storage not enough
    
Knowledge types: 
1. declarative knowledge: statements of fact
    - there is a candy taped under one chair in classroom
2. imperative knowledge: recipe or sequence of "how to" steps

Example: 
- statement of fact: 
    - sq root of a number X is Y such that Y * Y = X
- recipe (= algorithm): 
    1. Start with guess g
    2. If g * g is close enough to X, stop and say g is answer
    3. Otherwise make a new guess by average g and x/g
    4. Using the new guess, repeat process until close enough

Algorithm (= 1 + 2 + 3): 
1. sequence of steps (= checklist)
2. flow of control
    - process that specifies when each step is executed
    - E.g. when to go to next step or skip a step or go back to a step
3. a mean to determine when to stops
